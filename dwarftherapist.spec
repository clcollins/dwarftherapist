%description
Management tool designed to run side-by-side with Dwarf Fortress.
Offers several views and interface improvements to Dwarf Fortress.
Some features include:

Persistent custom professions - import and manage any number of custom
professions across all your forts.

Assign multiple dwarves to a custom profession at once to unify active labors.

Manage labors and professions much more easily than in-game using a flexible
UI, allowing quick review of all dwarves at-a-glance.

Display all pending changes before they're written to the game.

Sort labor columns by associated skill level.

Persistent and customizable display; change colors, reposition/hide
information screens.

Group your dwarves by several criteria.

This is a heavily modified version of the original Dwarf Therapist that
is still maintained for new versions of Dwarf Fortress.
